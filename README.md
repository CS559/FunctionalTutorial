# Functional Programming Tutorial for CS559

This is a review of some functional programming concepts in JavaScript
for CS559. 

Functional programming concepts (like closures) are extremely useful for 
graphics and user interface programming. The good news is that they are
well supported in JavaScript. However, they are tricky to learn: students
often need to see lots of examples before they make sense. 

This workbook provides a quick tutorial that reviews the functional programming
concepts in JavaScript. It tries to use examples that make it clear why they
are useful for basic web programming (since this workbook comes before we do
much graphics programming, it doesn't include graphics examples).

This workbook is optional. We will not collect it. We will not grade it.
You can be pretty confident there will be questions about closures and other
programming concepts on the exams. 

Unlike regular workbooks, for this one you should clone the public repository
you can do

    git clone git@github.com:CS559/FunctionalTutorial.git

assuming you have ssh set up correctly (which you should for class).

You can then start a web server in that directory, and look at `index.html`. 

You can read this tutorial without cloning the repo at: https://cs559.github.io/FunctionalTutorial
Cloning the repository will make it possible for you to edit the code and experiment.

**Note:** The repository "CS559/FunctionalTutorial" contains the "built workbook" (html). The workbook is actually written in Hugo. For staff who may need to edit the workbook, look elsewhere.
